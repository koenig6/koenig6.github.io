                <h3>Family Biking</h3>
                <p>Biking is best enjoyed when riding in the company of those we love the most. Biking as a family means time to bond and exercise. Here are some tips to help you with the logistics!<br><br><strong>Teaching Kids to Ride:</strong> From toddlers to teenagers, learning to ride a bike is fun but it can be a bit intimidating. Thankfully, there are many resources to help parents keep their sanity while keeping their children safe.<br><br><strong>Keep It Fun:</strong> What's the best part about riding a bike? Whether we ask kids or adults, their answer is not typically the efficiency, the low-cost factor, or the many health benefits. Rather, it's the joy that they experience when gliding through the air on two wheels! By keeping the instruction, ride, and destination fun, you're helping your child grow into a confident and resourceful adult.  </p>

            <h3>Ride the longest off-pavement route in the world.</h3>
            <p>The Great Divide Mountain Bike Route (GDMBR) is Adventure Cycling's premier off-pavement cycling route, crisscrossing the Continental Divide north to south. This route is defined by the word "remote." Its remoteness equates with spectacular terrain and scenery. The entire route is basically dirt-road and mountain-pass riding every day. In total, it has over 200,000 feet of elevation gain. Roughly 80% of it is composed of county, Forest Service (USFS), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) dirt and gravel roads. The remainder is made up of four-wheel-drive tracks and singletrack trails (10%), and paved roads (10%).</p>
